# Processing models generated in Blender
Project of class "Programação Orientada a Objetos"


In the development of visually appealing computer games it is
it is necessary to model numerous objects. For this, one of the tools
used is Blender. In this tool the user creates the models that are later exported
for a game engine.


## Requeriments:
1. The purpose of this project is to calculate / determine some information about objects
from the respective models previously saved in file in OBJ format. One of
fundamental information is the amount of material (area) of each object/model.
2. In addition to reading the models/files, it is necessary to implement several features,
through methods whose prototypes are presented below. Assume you have to
implement the classes SGestao, Vertice, Aresta, Face and Modelo, but that can and should
implement others that you consider necessary!!! Also assume that the SGestao can have several
models loaded into memory.


## Teammates:
- [Bruno Lopes](https://github.com/Brupes)  (did about 75% of code).
- Pedro Costa.
